# Laragine
We developed Laragine to make the software development using Laravel faster and cleaner, so you can get things done faster, not only that, Laragine is not about quantity only, it's all about quantity and quality.

### Features
It's very important to know why to use Laragine, here is why:

* A module based, meaning that you can separate all related stuff together

* You can create CRUD operations including the `requests`, `resources`, `models`, `migrations`, `factories`, `views` ...etc by doing simple stuff (don't worry, it's explained in the documentation)

* Unit Tests are also created!

* One clear response for the client side (for example: API response)

* Many helper functions/traits/classes that will come in handy while you develop! (error handeling, adding more info to the logs, security helpers ...etc)

### Getting Started
To get started please check the [documentation](https://yepwoo.com/laragine/docs/index.html)

### Contributions
Please note that Laragine source code isn't in its best version yet, currently our first priority is to rewrite the whole source code again so we can scale fast.

Any contribution including pull requests, issues, suggestions or any thing that will make Laragine better is welcomed and much appreciated.
